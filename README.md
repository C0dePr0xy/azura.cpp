# azura.cpp
Project Azura is a terminal based tool made using C++. I'm currently using this program to practice what I've learned and to make an actual project about it I guess. 💻 🐧

# Read "README.txt" for instructions on how to run.
- gif files will also be in release changelogs as well to provide visual aid for those who need it. 😄

# Project mission... ℹ️
The eventual mission of this program will be that this program will become a cli-based calender app where you can schedual meetings and plan your goals from the terminal like other calender apps such as Google Calender (just not as bif of course because I'm the only developer).
